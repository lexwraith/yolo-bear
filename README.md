Mike -  Started over from scratch
        Added in type declarations for functions
        Added in variable declaration and assignment of expression
        Added ccompile/ccode.ml to be used for actual compilation
        Microc now has a -C flag that is used for actual ccompile.translate
        Codegeneration has begun - need to adjust formatting and account for type_decl string formatting
        Mikhail helped
