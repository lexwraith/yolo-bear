In control/ folder, only the simplest cases are there. Needs to be tests for conditionals like if(x), not just if(x == 1), and many other cases. No edge cases are being tested for.

In types: I began to try and write out all the basic declarations and assignments, as well as basic operations for our primative types (int, char, and float so far). This folder should not be for testing functions, unless neccessary to test type operations. These tests should include all allowable syntax and edge case testing. The expected output files are not yet there! So these cannot be tested yet.

The simply/ folder is some copied simple programs from simplyprogramming.com. It would be good to add more of these. When adding new programs, make sure to convert them to our syntax (remove scanf, don't use other data types, etc).
